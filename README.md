# sigfish-haru

This is an early fork of [sigfish](https://github.com/hasindu2008/sigfish) which demonstrates the integration of Hardware Accelerated Read Until (HARU) for efficient and fast nanopore squiggle mapping. Building and usage instruction are described in the [HARU](https://github.com/beebdev/HARU) repostory.
